## Lab 1 - SQL Queries and Views
The lab1 is about The Jonson Brothers’ database on which we have to run several Queries and print the result.

## Lab 2 - Database design and ER modeling
The Jonson Brothers’ business is expanding and the database is continuously being extended with new information. The current state of the company database can be seen in the ER-diagram provided on page 8. The management of Jonson Brothers’ has hired you to help them extend their database. The work requires extensions to support a bonus system where managers can be given an extra bonus (e.g. if their department have met their sale predictions). The management also wants to encourage customers to shop more by creating a credit card that users can use when paying for items that they buy.
